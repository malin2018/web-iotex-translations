  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethereum.org/foundation">Ethereum</a> has
  revolutionized the blockchain world for the past four years and made
  “blockchain” the newest buzzword. As an industry leader, Ethereum has provided
  <a target="_blank"
  href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/03/07/announcing-beneficiaries-ethereum-foundation-grants/">grants</a>
  to fuel researchers and developers to work on various forefronts to support
  the entire blockchain ecosystem. IoTeX strongly believes that we can move
  forward the entire industry through rigorous research and collaboration. We
  need talents and the brightest minds to make a splash in the world. A small
  yet powerful way for you to help our cause is to donate ETH to the Ethereum
  Foundation to help fund blockchain research.

  Crowdsourcing as a way to fund a specific cause for a charity is not new, but
  IoTeX is doing it via “smart contracts” and redirecting the cryptocurrency
  hype to charitable causes. In the next few months, under its Community Reward
  Program, IoTeX will continue selecting a few charity programs that align with
  IoTeX’s mission of “Connecting the Physical World, Block by Block” as part of
  IoTeX’s Community Reward Program.


  IoTeX believes in growing together with the community and connecting the
  physical world block by block. It’s a very ambitious goal but it can be
  achieved with a strong team and supportive community. Together with the
  community to push the frontier for the development of the blockchain
  ecosystem, IoTeX truly hopes that the community can understand the original
  intention and help promote the cause.

  Despite its rapid evolution, IoT is still far from reaching mass adoption and
  lacks “killer applications” that would draw new users to the ecosystem due to
  issues such as low scalability, high operating cost, privacy concerns and lack
  of functional values.
home.about.sol.desc2: >-
  IoTeX is tackling this problem by introducing token economy into IoT spaces as
  we strongly believe that crypto incentives as well as the community effort are
  the two key forces to propel innovations in IoT space. In short, IoTeX is the
  next generation IoT-oriented blockchain platform with strong scalability,
  privacy, isolatability and developability for incubating new IoT applications
  and ecosystems.
